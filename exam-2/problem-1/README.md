All the functions necessary for the code to run. To successfully run the code, keep the file structure or make sure that functions are in the same directory as problem1.m.

## images
The images generated by the script. Images are eps files. GitHub will not display the images, though if you know Latex, they can easily be viewed there (or by changing the saveas file output to be a more readable format).

## .
Top level structure. The data used in the script is Q1.csv. Otherwise, the rest of the files are meant to run the script problem1.m.
