# Exam 1, Problem 2
All the files to successfully run problem 2 are included within. Note that the *total runtime* is about 10 seconds. Will likely be longer on another machine.

# Directories

## functions
All the functions necessary for the code to run. To successfully run the code, keep the file structure or make sure that functions are in the same directory as CircHM.m.

## images
The images generated by the script. Images are eps files. GitHub will not display the images, though if you know Latex, they can easily be viewed there (or by changing the saveas file output of CircHM.m to be a more readable format).

## .
Top level structure. The data used in the script is Q2train.csv and Q2test.csv. Otherwise, the rest of the files are meant to run the script CircHM.m.
