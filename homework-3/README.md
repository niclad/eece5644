# Homework 3 Code
Due November 4, 2019, 9:30 AM

## Included directories
1. [problem-1](problem-1) - all code for quesiton 1 in the homework. **_Really important note:_** for more than 10000 samples, this code takes over 2 hours to run. If code it only used to check simialrity to included graphs, data, etc. I would recommond the "samples" variable in [problem1.m](problem-1/problem1.m) is changed to produce a maximum of 1000 samples (will only take about 2 minutes).
2. [problem-2](problem-2) - all code for question 2
