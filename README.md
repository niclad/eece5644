# EECE5644 Homework Code for Nicolas Tedori
Rather than creating multiple repositories for multiple assignments, all assignments are stored in seperate folders within the same repository.

This will remain the case unless it's easier for everyone to create seperate repos for each assignment.

Folders will be added as homework is released.

## Homework Directories
1. [homework-1](homework-1) - All code files for homework 1.

2. [homework-2](homework-2) - All code files for homework 2.

3. [homework-3](homework-3) - All code files for homework 3.
	- *Note:* I was not able to complete homework 3, so there are incomplete problems.

4. [homework-4](homework-4) - All code files for homework 4.

## Exam Directories

1. [midterm](midterm) - All the files for the midterm (AKA Exam 1).
	- *Note:* these files are techinically incorrect. I was not able to complete the midterm, so there is stuff missing.

_all future homework directies added as they are assigned_
