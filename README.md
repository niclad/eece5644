# EECE5644 Homework Code for Nicolas Tedori
Rather than creating multiple repositories for multiple assignments, all assignments are stored in seperate folders within the same repository.

This will remain the case unless it's easier for everyone to create seperate repos for each assignment.

Folders will be added as homework is released.

## Current Directories
1. [homework-1](homework-1)
	1. [q2p3.m](homework-1/q2p3.m) - _code for question 2, problem 3_  
	2. [q2p3.eps](homework-1/q2p3.eps) - _plot for question 2, problem 3 (GitHub will not display)_  
	3. [q4p2.m](homework-1/q4p2.m) - _code for question 4, problem 2_  
	4. [plot1.eps](homework-1/plot1.eps) - _plot for question 4, problem 2 (GitHub will not display)_  
	5. [plot2.eps](homework-1/plot2.eps) - _plot for question 4, problem 2 (GitHub will not display)_ 
	6. [q5p3.m](homework-1/q5p3.m) - _code for question 5, problem 3_  

_all future homework directies added as they are assigned_
