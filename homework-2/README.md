All code is written in MATLAB.
## Files included are:
1. [MAP_Classify.m](MAP_Classifiy.m) - _abstract function that runs all for all the problems_  
2. [p1.m](p1.m) - _code for problem question 2, problem 1 - calls [MAP_Classify.m](MAP_Classify.m)_  
3. [p2.m](p2.m) - _code for problem question 2, problem 2 - calls [MAP_Classify.m](MAP_Classify.m)_  
4. [p3.m](p3.m) - _code for problem question 2, problem 3 - calls [MAP_Classify.m](MAP_Classify.m)_  
5. [p4.m](p4.m) - _code for problem question 2, problem 4 - calls [MAP_Classify.m](MAP_Classify.m)_ 
6. [p5.m](p5.m) - _code for problem question 2, problem 5 - calls [MAP_Classify.m](MAP_Classify.m)_  
7. [p6.m](p6.m) - _code for problem question 2, problem 6 - calls [MAP_Classify.m](MAP_Classify.m)_  
8. [run_functions.m](run_functions.m) - _a MATLAB script that runs all the functions (p1.m - p6.m) as a batch_
